<h2>Toll road management<br>
</h2>
</center>
Write a program to manage payments on toll roads.
All classes must belong to package <code>tollroad</code>
<h3>R1 - Customer management<br>
</h3>
<br>
Interaction with the system takes place through class <b>TollManager</b>.
New customers can be added by means of method <b>addCustomer</b>, which
accepts as arguments the SSN, first and last name.
<br>
It is possible to access information about a user, given her SSN, through method
<b>getCustomer</b>. This method returns the last name of the customer and throws
the <b>CustomerNotPresent</b> exception if the customer is not present.
<br>
<br>
<h3>R2 - Segment management<br>
</h3>
It is possible to add new segments through the method <b>addSegment</b> that 
accepts the code of the segment, the name of the starting location, the name
of the arrival location, and the toll price.
<br>
By means of method <b>getSegment()</b> it is possible to get the price of
a segment given its code, if there is no segment with the given code
a <b>SegmentNotPresent</b> exception is thrown.
<br>
<h3>R3 - Payment management</h3>
The transit of a customer through a segment can be signaled by means
of the method <b>transitOnSegment()</b>, which accepts as arguments
the customer's SSN, and the segment code.
<br>
The corresponding toll price must be added to the customer's debit.
Each customer has a given credit threshold (10.0 by default or set
through method <b>setCreditThreshold()</b>); if the customer
debit is greater than the credit threshold the method throws a
<b>CreditThresholdReached</b> exception after having incremented the debit.
<br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">totalDebt()</span> 
	returns the total debt accumulated by a customer. <br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">numberTransit()</span> 
	returns the number of transits made by a customer<br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">segments</span>()
	returns the set of codes of segments passed by a customer (without repetitions)<br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">resetCustomer()</span>
	resets the record of segment transits and the customer's debit.<br>
All the above methods in R3 accept as argument the customer SSN 
and throw a <span style="font-weight: bold;">CustomerNotPresent</span> exception.<br>
<br>
<h3>R4 - Statistics<br>
</h3>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">countTransit()</span>
	returns the total number of tansits recorded by the system.<br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">totalDebt()</span>
	returns the sum of all debits.<br>
Method <span style="font-weight: bold;">mostTransitedSegment()</span>
